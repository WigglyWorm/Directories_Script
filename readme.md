# Instructions

## Class Notes Folder

Create a script called `create_notes_drs.py`. In the file, define and call a function called `main` that does the following:

* Creates a directory called `CyberSecurity-Notes` in the current working directory
* Within the `CyberSecurity-Notes` directory, creates 24 sub-directories (sub-folders), called `Week 1`, `Week 2`, `Week 3`, and so on until up through `Week 24`
* Within each week directory, create 3 sub-directories, called `Day 1`, `Day 2`, and `Day 3`

**Bonus Challenge**: Add a conditional statement to abort the script if the directory `CyberSecurity-Notes` already exists.
